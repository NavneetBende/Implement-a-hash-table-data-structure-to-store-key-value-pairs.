Implement a hash table data structure to store key-value pairs.

SEE THE CODE

Here's an example of how you could use this class:

This implementation uses separate chaining to handle collisions. Each element of the array is a linked list, and when two keys hash to the same index, they are added to the linked list at that index. The hash() method uses the built-in hashCode() method to generate a hash code for the key, and then takes the absolute value of that hash code modulo the length of the array to get the index. The put(), get(), remove(), containsKey(), isEmpty(), and size() methods all use this hash function to locate the correct bucket in the array.
